"Scoot Hard DX is a fair use parody. My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic
is owned by Hasbro. This is not endorsed by them nor is meant to
replace any official product. It is also not intended for kids. It is
intended for mature audiences, suggested 18+ years of age.
Please support the official release.

Scoot Hard DX has wanton and gratituous violence, dark themes
including but not limited to dealing with authoritarianism, and edgy
based ironic humor. If these are not your thing, please shut off the
game and stop playing. And certainly don't go onto ResetEra and
bitch about it.

None of the characters are meant to be role models. It's fiction.
Fiction is not reality. Some of the things they would do would cause
a person to get hurt, expelled, arrested, possibly deported. To put
it another way: don't try any of this at home.

Waffle Iron Studios takes no responsibility for loss of sanity or
unironic comparisons to current year events. Please just enjoy
the game. Sanya created the prototype in 2014 for God's sake.",SHDX_TITLEMAP_DISCLAIMER,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"You can only carry one one missile weapon at a time.

Either use up your shots first, or swap it out by walking over
another weapon and pressing the use key (default is E) to swap
it out. The dropped weapon will contain the ammo as well. If you
pick up the same weapon you currently have, you will pick up
the ammo from it rather than swap it out.

Bullet Weapons:
Blaster - You start with this weapon. Never runs out of ammo.
Submachine Gun - Rapid fire goodness. Infinite ammo.",SHDX_HELP_MENU3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PLAYING THE GAME (VENDING),SHDX_HELP_HEADER_MENU5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Vending Machines cost 1 bit for an apple, 5 for a hot meal on
Easy. This is increased by 2x on Medium, and 3x on Hard and
Discourse. On Discourse coins are very rare, making using
vending machines less of an option. Whee for capitalism!
(Note: Sanya is not a Communist either so hush)

To use a vending machine, go up to one and press use. If
you don't have enough bits, or aren't hungry, it will tell you so.",SHDX_HELP_MENU5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PLAYING THE GAME (OBJECTIVES),SHDX_HELP_HEADER_MENU6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Fuck up anything that moves and get to the exit.

Find secrets along the way. Check for pushwalls.
These can contain hidden caches of goods. Also always
check the vent ducts. Always.

On some levels it might be a bit more complex than that,
namely the Pegasus Device. It shouldn't be too hard to blow it
up unless you work for Polygon. Just look around the place for
ways to destroy it.

On some levels there might be a Boss enemy. This enemy is
tougher than a normal enemy and is necessary to beat the level
and progress. They have specific patterns you must master and
look out for.",SHDX_HELP_MENU6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PLAYING THE GAME (KEYS),SHDX_HELP_HEADER_MENU7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Red, Green and Blue Keys are required to unlock areas of the
level. To unlock the exit, you must find a Management Keycard.
This also can be used to unlock the safety protocols on the
Pegasus Device.",SHDX_HELP_MENU7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PLAYING THE GAME (GLIDING),SHDX_HELP_HEADER_MENU8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo can't fly, but she can glide. Jump and hold down the
jump key (default is spacebar) and move forward to glide around.
Some secrets require being able to master this. You can look
around while you are in the air, but you can't change
direction while you are gliding.",SHDX_HELP_MENU8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PLAYING THE GAME (ARMOR SYSTEM),SHDX_HELP_HEADER_MENU9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo can equip three armor types.

Bulletproof Armor - Provides resistance to bullets.
Fireproof Armor - Provides resistance to explosives.
Weatherproof Armor - Provides resistance to lightning and wind.

These can stack. Picking up one gives you 100.",SHDX_HELP_MENU9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PLAYING THE GAME (CHICKEN MODE),SHDX_HELP_HEADER_MENU10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Occasionally you might find hidden, or in plain sight,
mystical buckets of chicken labeled 'EFS'. These Eldritch
buckets of chicken grant you the ability to become
an invincible chicken for about half a minute.

Fire - Peck their brains out!
Alt Fire - channel all your power into a Clustercluck. This

"Due to their importance in weather control
and other tasks, there's a certain bit of
nationalism and pride within the Pegasi
race, and thus within the Pegasi city of
Cloudsdale within Equestria. However,
something changed recently that made
that even more profound. And things got
really dark at the Cloudsdale Weather
Corporation, which became more
militaristic.",SHDX_INTRO_1A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pegasi across Equestria were
suddenly required to do fitness exams,
and if they failed, go through some
rigorous training program at the monolithic
facilities. However, there is no
training program, as one foal is
about to find out.",SHDX_INTRO_1B,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Meet Scootaloo, she, and her friend
Orion Solstice and another pegasi by
the name of Aurora Dawn all failed
their exams. Scootaloo and the others
enter the Cloudsdale Weather Corporation.
They're given a tour... an odd,
foreboding tour by a colt with the name of
Dr. Atmosphere. Sensing something
sinister, Scootaloo hatches a plan.",SHDX_INTRO_2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"During the tour, she wanders off into one
of the bathrooms that are under
construction. A guard chases after her.
She wrestles with the guard in the
construction zone, before exerting
enough force to snap his neck. The two
fall down a ventilation shaft thirty floors
to the surface - to the Clousdale
Weather Corporation's ground location.",SHDX_INTRO_3A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Cloudsdale had two locations -
a physical location, just north of Tchpsor,
Boredomdai, and the floating
part which was more mobile. It had stopped
being mobile as of late.
Fortunately for Scootaloo, she
survived the fall. The guard was not so lucky.",SHDX_INTRO_3B,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"She finds a two way CB radio and a
hoof blaster on the dead guard, as well
as his utility belt. The CB radio might be
useful to call for help. Surely someone
out there could help her. However, she
can't get a signal from here. She'd need to
get somewhere tall and out in the open.",SHDX_INTRO_4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Arming herself with the blaster and
strapping the utility belt up, she sees a door
ahead. Not knowing at all what is behind that
door, she has no idea. Her goal is
simple - survive and rescue Orion, and
Aurora if she can. There's no telling what
she's going to find.",SHDX_INTRO_5A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Despite what the suits
say, she's been trained by the best -
Rainbow Dash - even if she can't fly
very well, she can kick ass. She took down
one guard, what's another couple more?

""I gotta get outta here!""",SHDX_INTRO_5B,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After taking down Surprise, Scootaloo
looks at the door behind her with
determination. She can taste the
first bit of freedom from this place.

If only she was able to fly.",SHDX_EP1END_1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"She climbs a radio tower. She knows
neighboring Boredomdai might be able
to help contact mainland Equestria.
She manages to get ahold of someone.
Not holding her breath, she climbs back
down.",SHDX_EP1END_2A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Soon, however, she hears radio
chatter from the Cloudsdale Weather
Corporation - Equestrian forces arrive.
Immediately Pegapol guards open fire
on them. Scootaloo can hear it now -
Equestrian forces are calling in backup.
It's going to be war. She'll be rescued
eventually, she just needs to survive
long enough.",SHDX_EP1END_2B,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Soon, Dr. Atmosphere is informed
about his sister, Surprise, who died
at the hooves of Scootaloo. He is,
to put it mildly, pissed off and wants
nothing more than your blood. You
even hear him cursing you on one
of the CB radio channels.",SHDX_EP1END_3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Eventually she finds a computer room.
One of the screens lights up. She is
shocked at who it is. It looks like
Rainbow Dash. No! It can't be! This has to
be some sort of trick by the Pegasi Reich,
surely.

""Well, hello Scootaloo. It appears you're
causing trouble for your big sister."" She
says with a malicious grin.",SHDX_EP1END_4A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo was in shock. ""It can't
be... my big sister wouldn't work
for a place like this.""

The rainbow maned pony didn't
acknowledge. ""Surrender now,
Scootaloo.""",SHDX_EP1END_4B,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""There's nowhere to go. You try to
leave, you get caught in some nasty
crossfire. You stay in here, you'll
certainly die.""",SHDX_EP1END_5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""...Oh, and speaking of dying, next
time I contact you, say goodbye
to one of your friends!""

Scootaloo saw Aurora and Orion in
the back. They were terrified and
confused. Aurora was crying.

""YOU LEAVE THEM ALONE!""",SHDX_EP1END_6A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The dictatorial pony laughed.
""Nonsense. What fun would that be.
You have sixty minutes to comply,
bitch."" The screen then turned off.

Scootaloo knew what she had to
do. She had to rescue them. Even
if it meant running into Dr.
Atmosphere. She was really
upset at the betrayal of Rainbow
Dash, but her friends depended
on her more than ever.",SHDX_EP1END_6B,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Meanwhile in neighboring Tchpsor,
an off duty cop by the name
of Sanya K. Waffles is visiting
a local bar. Someone tells them
to turn on the news.

""Cloudsdale and Equestria
are at war!"" The random
patron said.",SHDX_EP1END_7A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sanya couldn't believe it.
War so close to her home.
She wondered what would
happen if it spilled over into
Boredomdai...",SHDX_EP1END_7B,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After killing Dr. Atmosphere, his
undead minions start to falter.
Scoots wonders how long these
experiments have been going on...",SHDX_EP2END_1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo takes the elevator back down
a floor. She sees a television screen.
It's the head pony - the one that
looks like Rainbow Dash. She's
got Orion Solstice over the
gaping maw of a machine.",SHDX_EP2END_2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Scootaloo, you killed my top
engineer... you ruined me,
now I'll ruin you!""",SHDX_EP2END_3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Orion looks at the screen.
""Don't worry Scoots, I love
you! Kick her flank!""

Scootaloo pounded on the TV
screen. ""LET HIM GO YOU
MONSTER!"" The authoritarian
pegasi didn't even acknowledge.
Scootaloo was forced to watch
it all, live.",SHDX_EP2END_4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The machine spits out bright
components - mainly red. Then,
she sees Aurora behind the
multicolored Pony. The
evil dictator takes out a
chaingun and fires it up in
the air, Aurora starts crying.",SHDX_EP2END_5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""You see Scoots, that's what
you get for fighting me. If you
don't surrender, it's going to
be Aurora next!""",SHDX_EP2END_6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo, trying not to cry
at the loss of her friend,
raises the CB radio and uses
it.

""Go buck yourself. You're not
my big sister anymore.""",SHDX_EP2END_7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo trashes the floor. There
was no guards around to see her,
nor to try to stop her. At this point,
Scootaloo has one goal in mind....

Rainbow... no, Maimbow... yeah,
Maimbow... she must die for her
crimes. And that machine must
be destroyed so that it will never,
ever cause any more death.",SHDX_EP2END_8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Meanwhile, a CB radio transmission
comes in asking for who called in the
report. Scootaloo answers, tells them
everything... the forces keep pushing
towards the front of the Cloudsdale
Weather Corporation... however, she
knows by the time they reach her
she'll be at Maimbow's headquarters.",SHDX_EP2END_9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo wonders... could this really
be Rainbow Dash doing all this.

One way or another, she must stop
this reign of terror...",SHDX_EP2END_10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Maimbow is extremely angry at the loss
of the Pegasus Device. She readies a
surprise assault on Scootaloo. In her
rage, she forgets Aurora. Aurora uses
this chance to get away. If she manages
to survive or not... and if Scootaloo can
find her...

Maimbow is armed to the teeth. And she
is not going to go down easily. It's do or die.",SHDX_EP3INTER_1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo stands over Maimbow. Maimbow
loses what appears to be a contact lens.

Her eyes aren't a deep rosey color, but a
golden amber. Suddenly it hits Scootaloo
it is Lightning Dust disguised as Rainbow
Dash! Why would she do this?",SHDX_EP3AEND_1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Why, Lightning Dust?""

""Because your so-called big sister ruined
me! What better way than to ruin her
and the legacy of the Pegasi! I wanted
her to suffer... I wanted her to be miserable...
so I weaseled my way up the Cloudsdale
Weather Corporation and hatched a plan...
to get back at not just her... but you as well!""",SHDX_EP3AEND_2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo took a step back. She couldn't
believe it.

""You did all this just to get back at me?
Ponies have died because of you!""

Maimbow started to falter. ""I know... I let
hate overflow me... and for that, I have paid
the price. I died at the hands of a disabled
pegasus who can't even fly! Who knew...
the very thing that I hated so much would
be the thing that would destroy me!""",SHDX_EP3AEND_3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo stood in awe as Maimbow
laid in her own blood.

""See Scootaloo, I knew you wouldn't
pass those required exams... so I knew
you'd end up here. and I'd be able to
destroy you in that machine... and then
I could some day amass an army to take
down Rainbow Dash and tell her it was
all her fault!""

Maimbow chuckled. ""I was such a
dumbass. I let my hate blind me.""",SHDX_EP3AEND_4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Maimbow faltered more as she lost
more blood. ""Forgive me... please...
whatever waits me beyond this,
I deserve and I am ready for.""

Scootaloo didn't answer. She couldn't
bring herself to respond. She stayed quiet.
Maimbow gasped for air... and died, not
knowing how Scootaloo felt.",SHDX_EP3AEND_5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Equestrian forces entered the room. They
see Scootaloo, stunned and not doing
very well. They carry her down. She
doesn't say a word. All she can
think about is her friends she
lost in this horrible place.

Orion... Aurora... and the fact
she lost herself too.

In The Rainbow Factory... where 
not a single soul gets through.",SHDX_EP3AEND_6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Meanwhile, Sanya is watching on TV
as Scootaloo is carried out. She can't
but help feel discontent with the outcome.",SHDX_EP3AEND_7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo stands over Maimbow. Maimbow
loses what appears to be a contact lens.

"Maimbow faltered more as she lost
more blood. ""Forgive me... please...

Aurora, who had been quiet, spoke up.
""I forgive you. I believe love can conquor
all evils in this world... if I were to let hate
consume me, I'd be no better than you.""",SHDX_EP3BEND_5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo thought for a moment. She then
spoke up. ""Aurora's right. I must end the
cycle of hate somewhere. However, rest
assured, I'm going to help ensure this
never happens again. Anywhere. Got it?""

Maimbow sheds a tear. ""Rainbow did
good.""

She gasps her last breath, then dies.",SHDX_EP3BEND_6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Equestrian forces entered the room.
Scootaloo, with a renewed sense of
purpose, looks at her new friend.

""I'm Scootaloo."" She says to Aurora.

""I'm Aurora Dawn. Thanks for saving me.""

The guard spoke up. ""Did Scootaloo really
fight her way through the factory to save
you?""

Journalists overheard, but guards kept
them at bay. Aurora and Scootaloo would
have time for interviews later.",SHDX_EP3BEND_7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Right now they needed time for themselves.
As the two lone survivors of what the media
would dub the Rainbow Factory of Terror,
they needed their rest.

Scootaloo and Aurora made a promise
that day, to each other.",SHDX_EP3BEND_8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Meanwhile, Sanya is watching on TV
and sees Scootaloo and Aurora. While
she wishes there were more survivors,
she hears rumors about what Scootaloo
did, and seeing Scootaloo packing heat...
she is impressed that Scootaloo pulled
all that off.",SHDX_EP3BEND_9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Way to go kiddo.""

Sanya said with a smirk.",SHDX_EP3BEND_10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Suddenly, Sanya gets a text. It's from
Togami, her boss. The rich bureaucrat
saw what happened and his superiors
are worried about the same thing
happening in Boredomdai. While
Sanya shares those concerns, she
knows how Togami works - cutting
funding is how he works, that's
his answer to everything.

This certainly won't have reprecuttions
if her hunches are right... but that's
another story.",SHDX_EP3BEND_11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
