ways to destroy it.

,,Intermission Intro,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Due to their importance in weather control
and other tasks, there's a certain bit of
nationalism and pride within the Pegasi
race, and thus within the Pegasi city of
Cloudsdale within Equestria. However,
something changed recently that made
that even more profound. And things got
really dark at the Cloudsdale Weather
Corporation, which became more
militaristic.",SHDX_INTRO_1A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pegasi across Equestria were
suddenly required to do fitness exams,
and if they failed, go through some
rigorous training program at the monolithic
facilities. However, there is no
training program, as one filly is
about to find out.",SHDX_INTRO_1B,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Meet Scootaloo. She, her friend
Orion Solstice, and another pegasi by
the name of Aurora Dawn all failed
their exams. Scootaloo and the others
entered the Cloudsdale Weather Corporation.
They were given a tour... an odd,
foreboding tour by a colt with the name of
Dr. Atmosphere. But something wasn't right,
and Scootaloo felt it.",SHDX_INTRO_2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"During the tour, she wanders off into one
of the unfinished bathrooms. She is spotted by a 
guard who chases after her in pursuit.
She wrestles with the guard in the
construction zone, before exerting
enough force to overpower him. The two
fall down a ventilation shaft thirty floors
to the surface - to the Cloudsdale
Weather Corporation's ground location.",SHDX_INTRO_3A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Cloudsdale had two locations -
a physical location, just north of Tchpsor,
Boredomdai, and the floating
part which was more mobile. It had stopped
being mobile as of late.
Fortunately for Scootaloo, she
survived the fall. The guard was not so lucky.",SHDX_INTRO_3B,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"She finds a two way CB radio and a
hoof blaster on the dead guard, as well
as his utility belt. The CB radio might be
useful to call for help. Surely someone
out there could help her. However, she
can't get a signal from here. She'd need to
go somewhere tall and out in the open.",SHDX_INTRO_4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Arming herself with the blaster and
strapping the utility belt up, she sees a door
ahead. Her goal is simple - survive and rescue
 Orion, and Aurora if she can. There's no telling
what unspeakable nightmares she'll encounter.",SHDX_INTRO_5A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Despite what the suits
say, she's been trained by the best -
Rainbow Dash - even if she can't fly
very well, she can kick ass. She took down
one guard, what's another couple more?",SHDX_INTRO_5B,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,Intermission Episode 1 End,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo was in shock, she was able to 
take down not only Surprise, but an entire
platoon of Rocket Guards. Catching her breath,
she carefully traverses the Crumbling room 
and gets to the door. She can
taste the first bit of freedom from this place.

If only she was able to fly.",SHDX_EP1END_1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"She climbs a radio tower. She knows
neighboring Boredomdai might be able
to help contact mainland Equestria.
She manages to get in contact with
someone. Not holding her breath,
she climbs back down.",SHDX_EP1END_2A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Soon, however, she hears radio
chatter from the Cloudsdale Weather
Corporation - Equestrian forces arrive.
Immediately Pegapol guards open fire
on them. Scootaloo can hear it now -
Equestrian forces are calling for backup.
It's going to be war. She'll be rescued
eventually, she just needs to survive
long enough.",SHDX_EP1END_2B,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Soon, Dr. Atmosphere is informed
about his wife, Surprise, who died
at the hooves of Scootaloo. He will stop
at nothing to gut you for what you have done.
You even hear him cursing you on one
of the CB radio channels.",SHDX_EP1END_3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Eventually she finds a computer room.
One of the screens lights up. She is
shocked at who it is. It looks like
Rainbow Dash. No! It can't be! This has to
be some sort of trick by the Pegasi Reich,
surely.

""Well, hello Scootaloo.""",SHDX_EP1END_4A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo was in shock. ""It can't
be... my big sister wouldn't work
for a place like this.""

The rainbow maned pony didn't
acknowledge. ""Surrender now,
Scootaloo.""",SHDX_EP1END_4B,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""There's nowhere to go. You try to
leave, and you'll be greeted with a barrage
of bullets. You stay in here, and you'll most
certainly die.""",SHDX_EP1END_5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""...Oh, and speaking of dying, next
time I contact you, you can say goodbye
to one of your friends!""

Scootaloo saw Aurora and Orion in
the back. They were terrified and
confused.

""YOU LEAVE THEM ALONE!""",SHDX_EP1END_6A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The dictatorial pony laughed.
""Nonsense. What fun would that be.
You have two hours to comply,
bitch."" The screen then turned off.

Scootaloo knew what she had to
do. She had to rescue them. Even
if it meant running into Dr.
Atmosphere. She was really
upset at the betrayal of Rainbow
Dash, but her friends depended
on her more than ever.",SHDX_EP1END_6B,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,Intermission Episode 2 Intro,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dr. Atmosphere needed to deal with
this threat and fast!

""Mein fuhrer, the filly is rapidly
approaching the pegasus device.
Most of our forces are away from
the facility, what should we do?""",SHDX_EP1INTRO_1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Maimbow calmly contemplated.

""Hm, is that so? Release the
enforcers.""

""...They are a bit unstable. I
think we need more time to
test them."" Dr. Atmosphere
uttered with caution in his
voice.",SHDX_EP1INTRO_2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""That bitch just waltzed in
and killed your wife. And
you’re just going to let her
get away with that? Are
you that weak?""

""Oh I'm not weak... if you
insist, but you’ll have to
control them, as I’ll be in
my lab far away from them.
Show that bitch what
they’re capable of, Mein
fuhrer.""",SHDX_EP1INTRO_3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,Intermission Episode 2 End,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo takes the teleporter back to
the main facility after killing the deranged
Dr. Atmosphere. She sees a television
screen. It's the head pony - the one that
looks like Rainbow Dash. They've got Orion
Solstice over the gaping maw of a machine.",SHDX_EP2END_1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Scootaloo, you killed my top
engineer... you ruined me,
now I'll ruin you!""",SHDX_EP2END_2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Orion looks at the screen.
""Don't worry Scoots, I love
you! Kick flank!""

Scootaloo pounded on the TV
screen. ""LET HIM GO YOU
MONSTER!"" The authoritarian
Pegasi didn't even acknowledge.
Scootaloo was forced to watch
it all, live.",SHDX_EP2END_3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The machine spits out bright
components - mainly red. It's
pumped into a nightmarish
contraption.",SHDX_EP2END_4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""You see Scoots, that's what
you get for crossing me. If you
don't surrender, it's going to
be Aurora next!""",SHDX_EP2END_5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo, trying not to cry
at the loss of her friend,
raises the CB radio and uses
it.

""Go buck yourself...""",SHDX_EP2END_6A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At this point, Scootaloo has one
goal in mind....

That pony, Rainbow Dash or not...
they must die for their crimes.
And that machine must be
destroyed so that it will never,
ever cause any more death.",SHDX_EP2END_6B,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,Intermission Pre Maimbow Fight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Maimbow is extremely angry at the loss
of the Pegasus Device. He readies a
surprise assault on Scootaloo. In his
rage, he forgets Aurora. Aurora uses
this chance to get away. If she manages
to survive or not... and if Scootaloo can
find her...

Maimbow is armed to the teeth. And he
is not going to go down easily. It's do or die.",SHDX_EP3INTER_1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,Intermission Episode 3 End (Shared),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo stands over Maimbow. Maimbow
loses what appears to be a contact lens.

His eyes aren't a deep rosey color, but a
golden amber. Suddenly it hits Scootaloo...
It was Lightning Dust, the pony that
Rainbow Dash got kicked out of the
Wonderbolts! Lightning Dust had
changed her identity. But why?",SHDX_EP3END_1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Why, Lightning Dust?""

""Because your so-called big sister ruined
me! What better way than to ruin her
and the legacy of the Pegasi! I wanted
her to suffer... I wanted her to be miserable...
so I weaseled my way up the Cloudsdale
Weather Corporation and hatched a plan...
to get back at not just her... but you as well!""",SHDX_EP3END_2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo took a step back. She couldn't
believe it.

""You did all this just to get back at me?
Ponies have died because of you!""

Maimbow started to falter. ""I know... I let
hate overflow me... and for that, I have paid
the price. I died at the hands of a disabled
pegasus who can't even fly! Who knew...
the very thing that I hated so much would
be the thing that would destroy me!""",SHDX_EP3END_3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo stood in awe as Maimbow
laid in his own blood.

""See Scootaloo, I knew you wouldn't
pass those required exams... so I knew
you'd end up here. and I'd be able to
destroy you in that machine... and then
I could some day amass an army to take
down Rainbow Dash and tell her it was
all her fault!""

Maimbow chuckled. ""I was such a
dumbass. I let my hate blind me.""",SHDX_EP3END_4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Maimbow faltered more as he lost
more blood. ""Forgive me... please...
whatever waits me beyond this,
I deserve and I am ready for.""",SHDX_EP3END_5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,Intermission Episode 3 End (Bad),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo contemplated for a moment.
She couldn't bear to think about all the pain
and misery Maimbow had brought her.
She lost two of her friends to this bastard.

She had her answer.

""You know what, you're right. I'll forgive
you...""",SHDX_EP3AEND_6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""..In hell.""",SHDX_EP3AEND_7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Maimbow was thrown into the second
barely functional Pegasus Device, head
first. The machine puked out every
color known to Pegasikind. Scootaloo
knew what she had to do.

The Pegasi race was too sick to save.
It was disgraced by the actions of the
Cloudsdale Weather Corporation.

It must be purged.",SHDX_EP3AEND_8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"She got control of the Enforcers using Maimbow's
amulet the SpectraWasps. She swore to exterminate
every last pegasi in Equestria and beyond,
starting with the remaining forces of the
Cloudsdale Weather Corporation. Those who
chose to surrender were gutted of their free
will, and forced to serve in her burning crusade.",SHDX_EP3AEND_9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The loss of Orion and Aurora had pushed
Scootaloo to insanity. She was now just as 
genocidal as Maimbow was.

Maybe even more so - as she wanted no
pegasi to remain by the time she was done.
Once she's done with them, who knows what
horrific crimes she'll continue to commit against
life itself.

Scootaloo is no more, her soul is but a fleeting
memory, and her body an empty husk of her
former self. All that remains is Absentia.

Here she will continue her war against life itself...
In the Rainbow Factory... where not a single
soul gets through.",SHDX_EP3AEND_10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,Intermission Episode 3 End (Good),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Aurora, who had been quiet, spoke up.
""Maimbow, I forgive you. I believe love can conquer
all evils in this world... if I were to let hate
consume me, I'd be no better than you.""",SHDX_EP3BEND_6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo thought for a moment. She then
spoke up. ""Aurora's right. I must end the
cycle of hate somewhere. However, rest
assured, I'm going to help ensure this
never happens again. Anywhere. Got it?""",SHDX_EP3BEND_7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Maimbow sheds a tear. ""Rainbow did
good.""",SHDX_EP3BEND_8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He gasps his last breath, before his life slowly
fades from his body.",SHDX_EP3BEND_9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo sees some sort of amulet that
Maimbow dropped. It has a weird symbol.
It appears to be what Maimbow used to
control the Enforcers. She breaks the
amulet. She hopes that frees them.",SHDX_EP3BEND_10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scootaloo, with a renewed sense of
purpose, looks at her new friend. The
two had survived the Cloudsdale
Weather Corporation.",SHDX_EP3BEND_11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""I'm Scootaloo."" She says to Aurora.

""I'm Aurora Dawn. Thanks for saving me.""

Scootaloo and Aurora made a promise
that day to each other... they'd remember
Orion, and never forget what happened here.

However, they also found it in their hearts
to forgive and learn from this. Equestria
would recover.

Scootaloo wanted to get back home. She
wanted to talk to Rainbow Dash...",SHDX_EP3BEND_12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
